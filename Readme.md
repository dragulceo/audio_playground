Audio Playground - working pitch shifter
========================================

This project is work in progress.

Made with [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io "Yeoman") and it uses [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org "AngularJS").  
The recorder functionality is made with help from [Recorderjs](https://github.com/mattdiamond/Recorderjs "Recorderjs").  
Uses web workers, web audio api, and other experimental apis so you need a good browser to be able to run it. (Firefox Nightly or Chrome Canary).

A built version is here: [http://dragulceo.github.io/audio_playground/](http://dragulceo.github.io/audio_playground/ "Example audio playground")
